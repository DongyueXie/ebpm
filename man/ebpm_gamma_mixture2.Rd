\usage{
ebpm_gamma_mixture2(x, s, grid = NULL, g_init = NULL, fix_g = FALSE,
  control_select_grid = NULL, control = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector of Poisson observations.}

\item{s}{A vector of scaling factors for Poisson observations: the model is \eqn{y[j]~Pois(s[j]*lambda[j])}.}

\item{g_init}{The prior distribution \eqn{g}, of the class \code{gammamix}. Usually this is left
unspecified (\code{NULL}) and estimated from the data. However, it can be
used in conjuction with \code{fix_g = TRUE} to fix the prior (useful, for
example, to do computations with the "true" \eqn{g} in simulations). If
\code{g_init} is specified but \code{fix_g = FALSE}, \code{g_init}
specifies the initial value of \eqn{g} used during optimization.}

\item{fix_g}{If \code{TRUE}, fix the prior \eqn{g} at \code{g_init} instead
of estimating it.}

\item{control}{A list of control parameters  to be passed to the optimization function. `mixsqp` is  used.}

\item{shape}{A vector specifying the shapes used in gamma mixtures}

\item{scale}{A vector specifying the scales used in gamma mixtures}

\item{m}{multiple coefficient when selectig grid, so the  b_k is of the form {low*m^{k-1}}; must be greater than 1; default is 2}
}
\value{
A list containing elements:
    \describe{
      \item{\code{posterior}}{A data frame of summary results (posterior
        means, and posterior log mean).}
      \item{\code{fitted_g}}{The fitted prior \eqn{\hat{g}}, of class \code{gammamix}} 
      \item{\code{log_likelihood}}{The optimal log likelihood attained
        \eqn{L(\hat{g})}.}
     }
}
\description{
Uses Empirical Bayes to fit the model \deqn{x_j | \lambda_j ~ Poi(s_j \lambda_j)} with \deqn{lambda_j ~ g()}
with Mixture of Gamma: \deqn{g()  = sum_k pi_k gamma(shape = a_k, rate = b_k)}
}
\details{
The model is fit in 2 stages: i) estimate \eqn{g} by maximum likelihood (over pi_k)
ii) Compute posterior distributions for \eqn{\lambda_j} given \eqn{x_j,\hat{g}}.
